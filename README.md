            Project - Network based pattern searching M S Sriharsha 

The project aims at creating a network application - where a 
multithreaded server and a client is implemented. The client would 
send to the server a filename and a word to be searched in the file. If 
the specified filename is not found, an exception could be raised.
If the specified filename is found, then all the lines in the file that 
contains the word or pattern is captured into a list and sent back to the 
client.

    The project needs to have the following program files
    1. search.py 
    2. client.py 
    3. server.py 
    4. default_text.txt

Note - 
 1. Run the server.py file first in terminal 
 2. then run client.py file
 3. input the filename you want to search for
 4. Enter the word you want to search for
 5. Type 'Exit' to close the client when finished
